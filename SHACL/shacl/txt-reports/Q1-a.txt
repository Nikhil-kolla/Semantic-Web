The constraint is to check whether every movie is having atleast one
director and released in atleast one country.

1) Also included messages in constraints to understand which constraint 
	it violating.
2) As the severity is not mentioned explicitly, it is taking as Violation
   which is the default one.
3) There are two types of movies here, One is from class 'movie' and the 
	other is from class 'TV show'.
4) As we have to check on every instance of movie and TV show, it is better 
	to apply constraints on the class rather than instances. So, our target 
	classes become class movie and class TV show.
5) For checking the constraint of having atleast one director, the path is to 
	be the Director property path and we use sh:minCount to check the minimum
	occurences of Director object.
6) For checking the constraint of releasing in atleast one country,the path is
	to be the Release country property path and we use sh:minCount to check the 
	minimum occurences of Country object.
7)	There are totally 47 results which are violating the constraints. As both 
	the constraints are placed separtely, for every instance of target class 
	checks for both the constraints. In every violation result, along with the
	focus instance node (which mean the title of movie or TV show), the message
	included in the constraints also gets printed.
