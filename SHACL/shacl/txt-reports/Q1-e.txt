The question to demonstarte the usage of sh:closed and
sh:ignoredProperties.

1) While writing the constraints graph, apart from the 
   properties on which we have applies constraints, if we do
   not need anymore new properties,
   We have to make sh:closed as TRUE which accepts a boolean 
   value, this indicates that the properties are restricted.

   To mention other properties which are allowed, we have to
   give their types in sh:ignoredProperties list with space 
   seperation.

   Here I have mentioned class Movie and class TV Show in the
   sh:ignoredProperties list. So, that other than the properties 
   of those types, all the properties of all the movies and 
   TV shows will be shown in validation report as violating.
