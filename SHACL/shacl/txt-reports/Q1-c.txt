The constraint asked is about to check the title contains only
alphanumeric characters and space.

1) As we have to check all the titles, we have to check on class 
   rather than instances.
2) The focus node is title.
3) sh:pattern is used to specify the regular expression we need.
	"^[A-Za-z0-9? ]+$"
	In this regex, the space after question mark allows, space in 
	the title.
4) sh:flags has many options. "i" defines to ignore case check.
